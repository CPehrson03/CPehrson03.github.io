          <h2 class="text-center"><em>Why Robin Williams Was A Great Idol And Actor.</em></h2>
            <p  class="thumbnail"> While Robin Williams was acting he had inspired many people in acting and/or other hobbies. Robin Williams almost always had a smile on his face. <br> <br>Even though some of his time on earth he was deeply depressed. He didn't want to show it because he doesn't want to mix his personal life with the world. He also didn't want to see the people around him suffer more than he did.<br> <br> Sadly, at 63 years old, Robin Williams passed away because of suicide. </p>
